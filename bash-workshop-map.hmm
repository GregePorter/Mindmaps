	explain what a command is
		A simple shell command such as echo a b c consists of the command itself followed by arguments, separated by spaces.
	where to go for help
		man
			man <command_name>
		help
			"help" is a command that will list all the built in commands for bash
				you can then type "help <command_name>" and get some more information and usage about that command
		google
			In this day and age, you will almost never be without a GUI which means you can minimize the terminal, or go to another computer, and use the ever helpful Google
				"unix command to list the contents of directory" yields many good tutorials about "ls"
		tldr
			https://tldr.inbrowser.app/
			also has an offline download app for the terminal
	explain what a shell is
		GUI vs terminal
			We have a computer and we need a way to interact with the it - there are a couple different ways to do that - the graphics (like with the cursor and the clicking) and the command line.
			The command line, or terminal, or shell, or the little black box on your computer. There is some slight different between those, but for our purposes today, they're all the same
			The GUI (or Graphical User Interface) is like the mouse and clicking
			Now, why would you use this?
				Fast way of doing repetative task
				less system intensive
				you have more flexibity - if you were just going to use the graphics, then you're locked into the options provided by that software
		Metaphor about the woods
			The command line, terminal, little black box is kinda like going into the woods. You're there for a reason, probably temporarlity, though there are some people who live out there.
			You have a backpack full of tools (like command line commands) that have a variety of uses. But it helps to know a bit about them to use them more effectively
			Or at the very least know how to learn about what they do
			Now, you could probably get away from tightly holding onto a list of steps
				like if you copy/paste the commands from a doc or email
			But if something is slightly amiss with the steps, then are you able to adapt?
			The goal of this workshop is to give you some confidence when you find yourself in front of a command line or terminal.
	define heirachy
		What is a folder/directory
			Just like a file folder, it's a thing you put stuff in - files or more folders, for example
		Give an exercise about how to visualize the heiarchy
			Open up some nesting dolls
		Think of the file heiarchy like a family tree
	Useful commands

		ls
		cd
		mkdir
		rmdir
		rm
