				Python Changes
					Yikezola
					What was I thinking with these names...
				Update R
				Remove Extra Files
		Project Strategy
			Meet with client
			Define project
				They kept saying they wanted GPUs
				They just wanted it faster
					Parallelize it!
						C++
						R
						Python
							I really kinda loathe Python
							The compilation of the cpp wrapped in python proved to be too much
			Communication strategy
				A bunch of emails to get started
					Asked them for guidance about the structure of the code
						They completely annotated the code
				Weekly emails as the project was underway
